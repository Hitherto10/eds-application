## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd educonnect-application
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
 
## Running the Application

### Development Server
Start the development server with hot module replacement:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Production Build
Build the application for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build
Preview the production build locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```

### Linting
Check code quality and consistency:
```bash
npm run lint
```

## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on **Vercel**. 

### Deploying to Vercel
1. Push your code to a connected Git repository
2. Import the repository in Vercel Dashboard
3. Vercel will automatically build and deploy on each push to the main branch

Configuration is managed through `vercel.json` and `vite.config.js`.

## PWA Features

EduConnect is built as a Progressive Web App and supports:
- **Installation**: Install directly on home screen (iOS and Android)
- **Offline Support**: Service Worker enables offline functionality
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time notification support
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device sizes

See `public/manifest.json` for PWA configuration.

## Architecture

### State Management
- **Authentication**: Handled by `AuthContext` for user login, permissions, and session management
- **PWA State**: Managed by `PWAContext` for install prompts and update notifications

### Protected Routes
Routes are protected through the `ProtectedRoute` component, which validates user authentication and role-based access.

### API Integration
API requests are configured through `axiosConfig.js` with automatic interceptors for handling authentication and error scenarios.
